# :scroll: Random Quote App

A quote app SPA that access an external random quote API displaying new quotes with each button press.

Check out a live test version [here](https://codepen.io/Normaly0/full/mdqMZwq)!

## :mag: About

This application was built as part of the [Front End Development Libraries Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/normaly/front-end-development-libraries).

It uses the react framework in combination with the redux library. For the API calls it relies on AXIOS.

As this was the first bigger application that I've built in react and I've also decided to combine it with redux it was a challenging but super exciting task.
The biggest challenge came from having to make a proper API call using AXIOS and then properly process all the received information, so it can then be passed to the page.

## :clipboard: Ideas

- twitter button autofills the quote + author
- ability to change the quote topic


## :wrench: How To Run

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Therefore make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

For more information check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/)!
